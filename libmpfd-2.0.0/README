1.1 Crashes when file names contain blanks


2. The "About" From Grigory Dmitrievich Gorelov's site

MPFDParser was created to process incoming POST data from client's browser.
It is useful for programming web interface for embedded devices line one chip
computer or electronic tools, developing server-side CGI and FastCGI
applications.

When invoked, the library accepts and parses incoming POST data part by part.
This is a good solution I think because large files content, if any, is
trasferred directly to disk (you also can direct it to memory if you wish).
Field content is always stored in memory.

You do not need to compile any third-party libraries to use MPFDParser, it is
dependency free and ultra lightweight.

MPFDParser is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.


3. Additional Comments from Jonathan Ben-Avraham, September 2014

Note that the MPDF Parser class parses the data portion of the HTTP request. It
does not parse the HTTP headers, as it assumes that you are using a server such
as mongoose or lighttpd that parses the HTTP request headers for you and passes
you the data portion of the request.

In a future version we will provide an HTTP header parser for use with simpler
servers that do not parse the request headers.
