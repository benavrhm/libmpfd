2. The "About" From Grigory Dmitrievich Gorelov's site

MPFDParser was created to process incoming POST data from client's browser.
It is useful for programming web interface for embedded devices line one chip
computer or electronic tools, developing server-side CGI and FastCGI
applications.

When invoked, the library accepts and parses incoming POST data part by part.
This is a good solution I think because large files content, if any, is
trasferred directly to disk (you also can direct it to memory if you wish).
Field content is always stored in memory.

You do not need to compile any third-party libraries to use MPFDParser, it is
dependency free and ultra lightweight.
